This HA Script to use Mikrotik Knot GW with BLE parser

The mikrotik Knot GW is a cheap-ish IOT gateway from Mirkotik -
https://mikrotik.com/product/knot. To be honest I'm not sure I would recommend
getting one for this usecase in particular, i think something cheaper, with
less power draw can be made with relative ease.

I'm using this to get data from multiple Xiaomi Mijia devices with firmware
